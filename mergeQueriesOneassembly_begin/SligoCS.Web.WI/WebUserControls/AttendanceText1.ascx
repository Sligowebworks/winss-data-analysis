<span class="datatext">Success is not just about high test scores. On these pages you can view data collected from your
	school about standards of the heart. Students who attend school 
	regularly, who feel safe and valued and make others feel safe and valued, and who participate 
	in extracurricular and community activities are more likely to become caring, responsible, and productive citizens.
<br /><br />
Consider these data along with other local data and observations.  What do these data and your
	observations say about the climate of your school community and the potential future of your students as adults?
